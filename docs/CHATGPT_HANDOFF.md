# F1LAB handoff for the next ChatGPT session

**Status at 2026-10-15 UTC:** qualifying research benchmark complete, first
canonical session contract/reducer in progress. Branch `feat/foundation`;
research checkpoint `b6835e7` was pushed to `origin/feat/foundation`. Check
`git log -1`, `git status` and `git ls-remote origin feat/foundation` for any
later checkpoint.

## What exists and what does not

- **Done before this run:** Monza 2025 practice/qualifying exploration; Sprint 2
  FastF1 feature builder, chronological backtest code and synthetic tests.
  The saved single-Monza result (MAE 2.70 positions, Spearman 0.823) is a
  one-event comparison, not a generalization score.
- **Implemented in this run:** project-scoped pytest collection, a public
  OpenF1 historical adapter with raw response cache and request pacing,
  common-source qualifying feature set, provider-labelled dataset merge,
  event-paired bootstrap and coverage outputs, and normalization tests.
- **Done in this run:** OpenF1 ingestion for 2023–2025, merged 2022–2025
  dataset, real 2024 model selection and 2025 held-out evaluation, five-model
  form ablation, one-event provider overlap audit, one manual historical-form
  trace, and executed notebook chart. See `EXPERIMENT_REGISTER.md`.
- **Now implemented in part:** Python Pydantic `SessionEvent`/`RaceState`, pure
  ordered reducer and deterministic seek. A real OpenF1 2025 Monza sample
  normalizes 53 post-start race-control messages. It has no positions or lap
  timing; it is not a complete replay.
- **Not done:** calibrated probabilities, prediction serving, full historical
  replay, 2D
  or 3D visualization, telemetry comparison, strategy, what-if, live and radio.
  The React frontend still renders the Vite starter screen.

## Why the provider changed

The initial local `qualifying_2022_2023_2024_2025.parquet` had only 360 rows:
17 conventional 2022 weekends plus 2025 Monza. The prior ingestion log hit
FastF1's 500 calls/hour limit. This run completed two more cached 2022
weekends, but uncached 2023 F1 timing failed; a direct 2023 Bahrain timing URL
returned HTTP 401. OpenF1 documents public historical data from 2023 onward
and returned Q phase times, FP3 results and driver/team identity. We preserve
the original dataset and build a separate source-labelled one. See
`DATA_CONTRACTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md` and [OpenF1 docs](https://openf1.org/docs/).

## Architecture and source map

`src/f1_racelab/data/fastf1_source.py` configures the local cache;
`features/qualifying.py` computes practice rows and post-Q labels;
`data/qualifying_dataset.py` stores FastF1 event Parquets;
`data/openf1_qualifying.py` stores OpenF1 JSON and normalizes 2023–2025;
`data/mixed_qualifying.py` combines providers;
`features/historical_qualifying.py` creates strictly lagged driver/team form;
`models/qualifying_backtest.py` and `models/qualifying_ablation.py` fit and
evaluate five candidate rankings. `IMPLEMENTATION_ATLAS.md` describes inputs,
outputs, formulas, tests and caveats per function. `ARCHITECTURE.md` diagrams
the actual data flow and partial unified replay architecture. The new
`session/contracts.py`, `session/reducer.py` and `session/openf1_sample.py`
provide the first canonical event/state path.

## Reproduction and evidence

```bash
uv sync --dev
.venv/bin/pytest -q
.venv/bin/python -m f1_racelab.data.openf1_qualifying --years 2023 2024 2025
.venv/bin/python -m f1_racelab.data.mixed_qualifying
.venv/bin/python -m f1_racelab.models.qualifying_backtest --dataset data/processed/qualifying_mixed_2022_2023_2024_2025.parquet --feature-set common
.venv/bin/python -m f1_racelab.models.qualifying_ablation --dataset data/processed/qualifying_mixed_2022_2023_2024_2025.parquet --feature-set common
.venv/bin/python -m f1_racelab.session.openf1_sample
```

The latest full test run passed **19/19** and Ruff passed; exact commands are
in `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`. Fixture tests are separate from the real provider data
and model experiment. Generated
datasets and metrics are under ignored `data/processed/`; inspect
`qualifying_mixed_manifest.json`, ingestion CSV, `qualifying_backtest/` and
`qualifying_ablation/`. The mixed file has 71 conventional weekends and 1,418
source rows, with 35/18/18 eligible train/validation/test events and
684/342/354 evaluated rows. Its SHA-256 is
`eef5a7277d2f62fdf263e94cadbc7a5f5c38cd6acdbea9dc00549d5caef37fd8`.
Ridge won on 2024 MAE (2.8362 vs FP3 2.8975). Its held-out 2025 MAE was
3.2433 vs FP3 3.3141, with paired event delta -0.0708 and 95% bootstrap
interval [-0.2934, +0.1587]. The interval crosses zero, so no reliable
improvement is claimed. The UI remains the Vite starter; no replay demo exists.

## Known failure and risk matrix

| Issue | Evidence | Effect / next handling |
|---|---|---|
| FastF1 uncached archive access | F1 timing URL HTTP 401 | Use OpenF1 historical data, keep source labels and raw hashes |
| Mixed provider best-lap definitions | FastF1 lap filter vs OpenF1 `session_result`; 2025 Monza matched exactly on available pairs | Extend overlap audit beyond one event; use common eight fields |
| Q1 pace proxy vs final Q classification | Pipeline target/label definitions | Report separately; phase-aware model remains future work |
| Limited uncertainty evidence | 18 held-out events; paired interval crosses zero | Avoid superiority or deployment claims |
| Team names and driver acronyms as identifiers | Current row schema | Audit transfers, substitutions and renamed constructors before production |

## Next five actions

1. Run the full checks for the new session foundation, then commit and push
   this second documented checkpoint.
2. Extend the real race sample with measured positions, laps and pit events;
   add source capability flags and replay checkpoints.
3. Build a shared frontend clock and 2D workspace from that replay pack.
4. Expand cross-provider overlap and as-of timestamp audits before promoting
   a qualifying model toward production use.

For tutoring, read `AGENT_WORKLOG.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_ATLAS.md`,
`ML_EVALUATION.md`, `TEST_EVIDENCE.md`, `DATA_CONTRACTS.md`, `DECISIONS.md` and
`GLOSSARY_FOR_LEARNING.md` after this page. The locked scope remains
`SOL61_MASTER_EXECUTION.md`; a passing ML benchmark will not finish it.
